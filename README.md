In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving financial markets, access to timely and accurate data is crucial for making informed investment decisions. With the proliferation of online trading and market analysis tools, individual investors and financial professionals need efficient ways to gather, analyze, and visualize stock market trends. This project addresses that need by developing an interactive dashboard, leveraging Python and yfinance to streamline the process of accessing and analyzing historical financial data, making it easier for users to track stock performance and apply technical analysis.


# Objective
The main objective of this project is to build an interactive dashboard that allows users to:
Access historical stock data for various companies using Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library.
Visualize stock price trends over selected time periods, including daily open, close, high, low, and adjusted closing prices.
Compare multiple stocks side-by-side to analyze performance differences over specific periods.
Analyze financial patterns by calculating moving averages and other statistical indicators that inform investment strategies.
Export data and visualizations for further analysis or reporting.
# Goal
The goals of this project are:
Improve financial decision-making by enabling users to visualize and compare stock data efficiently.
Encourage exploratory data analysis (EDA) for investors and analysts by integrating interactive components that let users dynamically adjust the data inputs and analyses.
